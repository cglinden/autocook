 *
 * MANIFEST: functions to access the builtin functions
 *
 * The builtin functions all append their results to the supplied
 * `result' word list.  The first word of the `args' word list
 * is the name of the function.
 *
 * all of the functions return 0 in success, or -1 on error.
 *
 * Only a limited set of functionality is candidate for builtin functions,
 * these are
 *      - string manipulation [dirname, stringset, ect ]
 *      - environment manipulation [getenv(3), etc]
 *      - stat(3) related functions [exists, mtime, pathname, etc]
 *      - launching OS commands [execute, collect]
 * The above list is though to be exhaustive.
 *
 * Explicitly and forever excluded from being a builtin function
 * is anything which knows or understands the format of some secific
 * class of files.
 *
 * Access to stdio(3) has been thought of, and explicitly avoided.
 * Mostly because a specialist program used through [collect]
 * will almost always be far faster.
