/*
 * NAME
 *      opcode_new
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 *      opcode_ty *opcode_new(void);
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      The opcode_new function is used to allocate a new instance of an
 *      opcode in dyna,mic memory, and perform base class
 *      initializations (the vptr, mostly).
 *
 * RETURNS
 *      opcode_ty *; generic pointer to opcode
 *
 * CAVEAT
 *      Must be used only internally to creating instances of derived
 *      opcode classes.
