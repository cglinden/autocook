 * NAME
 *      graph_recipe_pairs
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      void graph_recipe_pairs(void);
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      The graph_recipe_pairs function is used to print pair-wise file
 *      dependency information on the standard output.  The format is
 *      similar to lorder(1) output.  This can be used to draw
 *      dependency graphs.
 *
 * RETURNS
 *      done, always
