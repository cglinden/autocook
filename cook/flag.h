 * MANIFEST: interface definition for cook/flag.c
 *
 *
 * If you are going to add a new recipe flag (set by the "set" statement,
 * or the "set" clause of a recipe) you need to change all of the
 * following places:
 *
 * cook/option.h
 *     to define the OPTION_ value
 * cook/option.c
 *     option_tidyup()
 *         if the option defaults to true
 *     option_set_errors()
 *         if the option should be turned off once cookbook errors
 *         are encountered.
 *     option_number_name()
 *         for the name of the option
 * cook/flag.h
 *     to define the RF_ values (RF stands for Recipe Flag)
 * cook/flag.c
 *     to define the RF_ names
 * langu.flags.so
 *     to document the recipe flag
 *
 * If you choose to make it a command line option,
 * you must also update these files:
 *
 * cook/main.c
 *     to define the new command line option and process it
 *     (only if it should also be a command line option)
 * cook/builtin/options.c
 *     to access the option from within the cookbook (typically used
 *     for recursive cook invokations)
 * lib/en/man1/cook.1
 *     to document it, if you added a new command line option
