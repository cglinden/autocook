/*
 * NAME
 *      builtin_cando - test if know how to cook given files
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 *      int builtin_cando(string_list_ty *result, string_list_ty *args);
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      The cando function is a built-in of cook, which may be used to
 *      determine which files can be cooked.
 *
 * RETURNS
 *      A word list containing all of the arguments for which derivations
 *      can be found, or nothing if none can.
 *
 * CAVEAT
 *      The returned result is in dynamic memory.
 *      It is the responsibility of the caller to dispose of
 *      the result when it is finished, with a string_list_destructor() call.
