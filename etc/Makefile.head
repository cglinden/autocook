#       2. etc/libdir.so
#       3. etc/libdir.h

# If you change this Makefile, you may also need to change these files.
# To see what is configured by the configure script, search for @ in the

# If you wish to reconfigure the installation directories it is
# RECOMMENDED that you re-run the configure script.
