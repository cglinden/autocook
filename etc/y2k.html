Year 2000 Status</h1>
Cook does not suffer from Year 2000 problems.
<ul>
<li>
Cook stores dates internally in Unix style (<i>i.e.</i> seconds
offset), so internal storage of times and dates does not suffer from
any Y2K problems.
<li>
Cook always uses the ANSI C standard <tt>strftime</tt> function to display
times and dates.  (This assumes that your vendor has supplied a compliant
<tt>strftime</tt>.)  This means that displaying dates does not assume
fixed field widths, nor will it display the year 2000 as ``100''.
<li>
When a user enters dates, they may specify years with an explicit century.
If a user enters a year with an implicit century, the closest is assumed.
</ul>
