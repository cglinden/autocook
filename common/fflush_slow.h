  * The fflush_slowly function is used to flush a file stream and check
  * success.  If errors are encountered allow for a pause and retry.
  *
  * The functionality and calling interface is identical to the fflush()
  * function:
  *
  *     "The function fflush forces a write of all user-space buffered
  *     data for the given output or update stream via the stream's
  *     underlying write function.  The open status of the stream is
  *     unaffected."
  *
  * If errors are encountered allow for a pause and retry.  This is
  * cultural imperialist tourist mode: When English doesn't work try
  * loud, slow English.
  *
  * @param stream.
  *     The stream to flush If the stream argument is NULL this function
  *     flushes all open output streams.
  * @returns
  *     Upon successful completion 0 is returned.  Otherwise, EOF is
  *     returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
  *     error.
