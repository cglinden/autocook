 * NAME
 *      gettext
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      The gettext function is used to translate messages into a
 *      language dictated by the LANG environment variable (et al).  If
 *      the current operating system does not supply one, then pass the
 *      message through unchanged.  (This is what gettext will do for
 *      error messages it does not have a translation for.)
