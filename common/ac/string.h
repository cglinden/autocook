/**
  * The strendcpy function is a buffer-overrun-safe replacement for
  * strcpy, strcat, and a more efficient replacement for strlcpy and
  * strlcat.
  *
  * Unless there is no space left in the buffer (dst >= end), the result
  * will always be NUL terminated.
  *
  * @param dst
  *     The position within the destination string buffer to be copied into.
  * @param src
  *     The string to be copied into the buffer.
  * @param end
  *     The end of the string buffer being copied into.  In most cases
  *     this is of the form "buffer + sizeof(buffer)", a constant which
  *     may be calculated at compile time.
  * @returns
  *     A pointer into the buffer where at the NUL terminator of the
  *     string in the buffer.  EXCEPT when an overrun would occur, in
  *     which case the \a end parameter is returned.
  *
  * @note
  * The return value is where the next string would be written into the
  * buffer.  For example, un-safe code such as
  *
  *     strcat(strcpy(buffer, "Hello, "), "World\n");
  *
  * can be safely replaced by
  *
  *     strendcpy(strendcpy(buffer, "Hello, ", buffer + sizeof(buffer)),
  *         "World\n", buffer + sizeof(buffer));
  *
  * and overruns will be handled safely.  Similarly, more complex string
  * manipulations can be written
  *
  *     char buffer[100];
  *     char *bp = buffer;
  *     bp = strendcpy(bp, "Hello, ", buffer + sizeof(buffer));
  *     bp = strendcpy(bp, "World!\n", buffer + sizeof(buffer));
  *
  * all that is required to test for an overrun is
  *
  *     if (bp == buffer + sizeof(buffer))
  *         fprintf(stderr, "Overrun!\n");
  *
  * On the plus side, there is only one functionto remember, not two,
  * replacing both strcpy and strcat.
  *
  * There have been some quite viable replacements for strcpy and strcat
  * in the BSD strlcpy and strlcat functions.  These functions are
  * indeed buffer-ovrrun-safe but they suffer from doing too much work
  * (and touching too much memory) in the case of overruns.
  *
  * Code such as
  *
  *     strlcpy(buffer, "Hello, ", sizeof(buffer));
  *     strlcat(buffer, "World!\n", sizeof(buffer));
  *
  * suffers from O(n**2) problem, constantly re-tracing the initial
  * portions of the buffer.  In addition, in the case of overruns, the
  * BSD versions of these functions return how big the buffer should
  * have been.  This functionality is rarely used, but still requires
  * the \a src to be traversed all the way to the NUL (and it could be
  * megabytes away) before they can return.  The strendcpy function does
  * not suffer from either of these performance problems.
