/*
 * NAME
 *      column_width - determine column width of a wide character
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 *      int column_width(wchar_t);
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      The column_width function is used to determine the column width
 *      if a wide character.  This is particularly hard to do,
 *      especially if you have read the ISO C standard ammendments.
 *
 * WEASEL WORDS
 *      This is the phrase used by P.J. Plauger in his CUJ columns about
 *      standard C and C++, specially when the standard dances all
 *      around the issue, rather than actually solving anything.  Take a
 *      squiz at these classic weasel words...
 *
 *      In the original standard, ISO/IEC 9899:1990, 7.3 Character
 *      handling <ctype.h> reads as follows (3rd paragraph):
 *
 *              The term <i>printing character</i> refers to a member of
 *              an implemntation defined set of characters, each of
 *              which occupies one printing position on a display
 *              device; the term <i>control character</i> refers to a
 *              member of an implementation defined set of characters
 *              that are not printing characters.
 *
 *      The following 2 sections are from ISO/IEC 9899:1990/Amd. 1:1995 (E):
 *
 *      7.15.2 Wide-character classification utilities (2nd paragraph)
 *
 *              The term <i>printing wide character</i> refers to a
 *              member of a locale-specific set of wide characters, each
 *              of which occupies at least one printing position on a
 *              display device; the term <i>control wide character</i>
 *              refers to a member of a locale-specific set of wide
 *              characters that are not printing wide characters.
 *
 *      [ Notice how they weasel out by not-quite contradicting 7.3: a
 *      printing <i>char</i> is exactly one printing position wide, but
 *      a printing <i>wchar_t</i> is one or more printing positions
 *      wide. ]
 *
 *      H.14 Column width
 *
 *              The number of characters to be read or written can be
 *              specified in existing formatted i/o functions.  On a
 *              traditional display device that displays characters with
 *              fixed pitch, the number of characters is directly
 *              proportional to the width occupied by the characters.
 *              So the display format can be specified through the field
 *              width and/or the precision.
 *
 *              In formatted wide-character i/o functions, the field
 *              width and the precision specify the number of wide
 *              characters to be read or written.  The number of wide
 *              characters is not always directly proportional to the
 *              width of their display.  For example, with Japanese
 *              traditional display devices, a single-byte character
 *              such as an ASCII character has half the width of a Kanji
 *              character, even though each of them is treated as one
 *              wide character.  To control the display format for wide
 *              characters, a set of formatted wide-character i/o
 *              functions were proposed whose metric was the column
 *              width instead of the character count.
 *
 *              This proposal was supported only by Japan.  Critics
 *              observed that the proposal was based on such traditional
 *              display devices with a fixed width of characters, while
 *              many modern display devices support a broad assortment
 *              of proportional pitch type faces.  Hence, it was
 *              questioned whether the extra i/o functions in this
 *              proposal were really needed or were sufficiently
 *              general.  Also considered were another set of functions
 *              that return the column width for any kind of display
 *              devices for a given wide-character string; but these
 *              seemed to be beyond the scope of the C language.  Thus
 *              all proposals regarding column width were withdrawn.
 *
 *      [ Notice how 7.15.2 specifically states that each printing
 *      character has a non-zero width measurable in <i>printing
 *      positions</i>.  Why is this metric is unavailable to the
 *      C programmer?  Presumably it is OK for an informational appendix
 *      to contradict the body of the standard. ]
 *
 *      [ The section ends with a compliant-but-non-standard way a
 *      standard C library implementor may choose to do this.  You can't
 *      reply on it being there, and you can't reply on the suggested
 *      semantics being used, so don't even bother having ./configure go
 *      look for it. ]
 *
 * SO FAKE IT
 *      Since there is no standard way to determine character width, we
 *      will have to fake it.  Hopefully, locales that need it will
 *      define something useful.  If you know of any, please let me
 *      know.
