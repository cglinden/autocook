/*
 * NAME
 *      sub_identifier - the identifier substitution
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 *      string_ty *sub_identifier(wstring_list_ty *arg);
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      The sub_identifier function implements the identifier substitution.
 *      The identifier substitution is replaced by the single argument
 *      mapped to a C identifier.  All characters which are not legal in
 *      a C identifier are replaced by an underscore.
 *
 *      Requires exactly one argument.
 *
 * ARGUMENTS
 *      arg     - list of arguments, including the function name as [0]
 *
 * RETURNS
 *      a pointer to a string in dynamic memory;
 *      or NULL on error, setting suberr appropriately.
