.H 1 "Glossary"
This document employs a number of terms specific to
.BR cook .
.VL 1i
.\"===============================================================
.LI \fIbody\fR
A set of statements, usually commands, to be performed
to
.I cook
the
.IR target s
of a
.I recipe
after the
.IR ingredient s
exist.
.\"===============================================================
.LI \fIcommand\fR
A command is a list of words to be passed to the
.I "operating system"
to be executed.
.\"===============================================================
.LI \fIcook\fR
When used as a verb,
refers to the actions
.B cook
would
perform to create a
.IR target ,
according to some
.IR recipe .
.\"===============================================================
.LI \fIcookbook\fR
A file containing input for
.BR cook ,
usually
.IR recipe s.
.\"===============================================================
.LI "\fIexplicit recipe\fR"
An explicit recipe is one where the
.IR target s
contain no patterns.
That is, there are no percent ('\fB%\fP') characters in any of the
.IR target s.
.\"===============================================================
.LI \fIfingerprint\fR
A cryptographically strong hash of the contents of a file,
use to determine if the file contents have changed.
.\"===============================================================
.LI \fIflag\fR
A flag modifies the behavior of a cook session,
.I recipe
or command.
.\"===============================================================
.LI "\fIforced ingredient\fR"
A files which must exist before a
.I target
file
of an
.I "implicit recipe"
may be cooked.
The inability to construct a forced ingredient
is an error.
.\"===============================================================
.LI \fIfunction\fP
A function is an action applied to a word list.
.\"===============================================================
.LI \fIgate\fR
A gate is a condition which allows the conditional application of
a
.IR recipe .
The gate condition is in addition to the requirement that the
ingredients are cookable.
.\"===============================================================
.LI "\fIimplicit recipe\fR"
An implicit recipe is a recipe with patterns in the
.IR target s.
That is, there is a percent ('\fB%\fP') character in at least one of the
.IR target s.
.\"===============================================================
.LI \fIingredient\fR
A files which must exist before a
.I target
file may be cooked.
In an
.I "implicit recipe"
the inability to construct of an ingredient
means that the
.I recipe
will not be applied.
In an explicit recipe
the inability to construct an ingredient is an error.
.\"===============================================================
.LI "\fIlast-modified time\fR"
.br
\s-4UNIX\s0 imbues files with several attributes.
One of these is a time-stamp of when the file was last modified.
Usually this is when the file was last written to.
.\"===============================================================
.LI \fIrecipe\fR
A
.I recipe
consists of several parts.
.AL
.LI
A set of
.IR target s
to be cooked,
.LI
A set of ingredients of those
.IR target s,
and
.LI
An optional set of forced ingredients.
.LI
An optional set of flags.
.LI
An optional gate.
.LI
An optional body .
.LE
.\"===============================================================
.LI \fItarget\fR
The object of a
.IR recipe ,
a thing which is cooked.
.\"===============================================================
.LI \fItouch\fR
UNIX imbues files with several attributes.
One of these is a time-stamp of when the file was last modified.
Usually this is when the file was last written to,
however it is possible to simply adjust this attribute,
rather than actually writing to the file;
this is colloquially known as
.IR touch ing
a file.
.\"===============================================================
.LI \fIvariable\fR
A variable is a named place holder for a value.
The value may be changed.
.\"===============================================================
.LE
