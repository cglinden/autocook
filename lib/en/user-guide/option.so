.\" MANIFEST: User Guide, Option Precedence

.H 1 "Option Precedence"
At various points in the description there are a number of flags and options
with the same,
or similar,
names.
These are in fact different levels of the same option.
.P
The different levels,
from highest precedence to lowest,
are as follows.
.VL 1i
.LI "Error"
This level is used to disable undesirable side effects when an error occurs.
.LI "Command Line"
Options specified on the command line override almost everything.
There are some isolated cases where there is no equivalent command line option.
They are in scope for the entire
.B cook
session.
.LI "Execute"
When a command attached to a recipe is executed,
the flags in the '\fBset\fP' clause are given this precedence.
They are in scope for the duration of the execution of the command they are
bound to.
.LI "Recipe"
When a recipe is considered for use,
the flags in the '\fBset\fP' clause are given the precedence.
They are in scope for the evaluation of the ingredients names and the
execution of the recipe body;
they are not in scope while cooking the ingredients.
.LI "Cookbook"
When a '\fBset\fP' statement is encountered in the cookbook,
the option are given this priority.
They are in scope until the end of the
.B cook
session.
.LI "Environment Variable"
.br
When the  options in the
.B COOK
environment variable are set,
they are given this precedence.
They are in scope for the entire
.B cook
session.
.LI "Default"
All options have a default setting.
The defaults noted in chapter 3
are given this precedence.
They are in scope for the entire
.B cook
session.
.LE
