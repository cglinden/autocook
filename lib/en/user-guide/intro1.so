.H 1 "Cook from the Outside"
This chapter is part of the tutorial on how to use the
.B cook
program.
It focuses on how to use
.BR cook ,
without needing to know how
.B cook
works internally.
.H 2 "What can cook do for me?"
By far the most common use of cook,
by experts and beginners alike,
is to issue the command
.eB
cook
.eE
and cook will consult its cookbook to see what needs to be done.
.P
In general,
.B cook
is used to take a set of files and chew on them in some way to produce
another set of files;
such as the source files for a program,
and how to turn them into the executable program file.
In order for
.B cook
to do anything useful,
it needs to know what to do.
"What to do" is contained in a file called
.IR Howto.cook
in the same directory as the files it is going to work on.
You need to execute the  \f(CWcook\fP command in
the same directory as all of the files.
.H 2 "What is cook doing?"
The
.I Howto.cook
file was written by the same person who wrote the source files.
It contains a set of recipes;
each of which, among other things,
contain commands for how to manipulate the files.
The
.B cook
program echos each of the commands it is about to execute,
so that you can watch what it is doing as it goes.
.P
If the
.I Howto.cook
file contained only commands,
you would be better off using a shell script.
In addition to the commands is information telling
.B cook
which files need to be constructed before other files can be,
and from this information
.B cook
determines the order in which to execute the commands.
Also,
.B cook
examines other information to determine which commands it need not do,
because the associated files are already up-to-date.
.H 2 "What can cook always do?"
If you are in a directory with a
.I Howto.cook
file,
you can expect a few common requests to work
.VL 1.5i
.LI "cook clobber"
This command can be expected to remove any files from the directory which
.B cook
is able to reconstruct.
.LI "cook all"
This is the default action,
and so can be obtained by a simple \f(CWcook\fP request.
It causes
.B cook
to construct some specific file or set of files.
.LI "cook clean"
This is similar to "cook clobber" above,
but it only removes intermediate files,
and not not the final file or files which "cook all" constructs.
.LE
.P
In addition to the above,
many
.I Howto.cook
files will also define
.VL 1.5i
.LI "cook install"
If a program or library or document is constructed in the directory,
the this command will install it into the correct place in the
system.
.LI "cook uninstall"
The reverse of the above,
it removes something from the system.
.LE
.H 2 "If something goes wrong"
Most errors while
.B cook
is constructing file are caused by errors in the source files,
and not the
.I Howto.cook
file.
In general,
you can fix the problems in the source files,
and execute the
.B cook
command again,
and
.B cook
will resume from the command which incurred the error.
.P
To help you while editing the files with the errors,
.B cook
keeps a listing file of all the commands it executed,
and any output of those commands,
in a file called
.I Howto.list
in the current directory.
.P
You may want
.B cook
to find all the errors it can before you do any editing,
do do this,
use the
.B -Continue
option (it may be abbreviated to
.B -c
for convenience).
.H 2 "The Reference Manual"
For more information about the command line arguments and options
of the various commands mentioned,
you should consult the on-line manual pages.
The Cook Reference Manual is also a good source of this information,
and is available from the same place as you obtained this manual.
