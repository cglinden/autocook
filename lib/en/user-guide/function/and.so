.H 2 "and"
This function requires at least two arguments,
upon which it forms a logical conjunction.
The value returned is "1" (true) if none of the arguments are "" (false),
otherwise "" (false) is returned.
.H 3 "Example"
The following cookbook fragment shows
how to use the [and] function in conditional recipes.
.eB
#if [and [defined change] [defined baseline]]
\fI\&...do something...\fP
#endif
.eE
This fragment will only
.I "do something"
if both the
.I change
and
.I baseline
variables are defined.
.H 3 "Caveat"
This function is rather clumsy,
and probably needs to be replaced by a better syntax
within the cokbook grammar itself.
.P
This function does not short-circuit evaluation.
.H 3 "See Also"
