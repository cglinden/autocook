.H 2 "suffix"
The
.I suffix
function treats each argument as a filename,
and extracts the suffix from each.
If the filename contains a period,
the suffix is everything starting with the last period.
Otherwise,
the suffix is the empty string (as opposed to nothing at all).
.H 3 "Example"
.TS
center,tab(;);
l l.
Expression;Result
_
[suffix a.c foo b.y];.c "" .y
[suffix stat.cache.c];.c
[suffix .eric];""

Quotes are used here for clarity, and are not present in the internal
representation of strings.

The
.I suffix
functions in this way to allow sensible results when using the
.I join
function to re-unite filenames dismembered by the
.I basename
and
.I suffix
functions.
