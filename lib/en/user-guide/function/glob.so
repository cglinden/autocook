.H 2 "glob"
Each argument is treated as a
.IR sh (1)
file name pattern,
and expanded accordingly.
The resulting list of filenames is sorted lexicographically.
.P
You may need to quote the pattern,
to protect square brackets from the meaning cook attaches to them.
.P
.B Note:
The character sequence \f(CW/*\fP is a comment introducer,
and is a frequent source of problems when combined with the
.I glob
function.
Remember to quote
.I glob
arguments which need this character sequence.
See the [head] function, below, for an example of this.
.H 3 "Example"
To find the sources in the current directory:
.eB
src = [glob *.c];
obj = [fromto %.c %.o [src]];
.eE
.H 3 "See Also"
filter,
filter_out,
shell
.H 3 "Also Known As"
wildcard
