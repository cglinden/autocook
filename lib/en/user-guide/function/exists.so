.H 2 "exists"
This function requires one argument,
being the name of a file to test for existence.
The resulting word list is "" (false) if the file does not exist,
and "1" (true) if the file does exist.
.H 3 "Example"
To remove the target of a recipe before building it again:
.eB
%.a: [%_obj]
{
        if [exists [target]] then
                rm [target]
                        set clearstat;
        [ar] qc [target] [%_obj];
}
.eE
Note:
you
.I must
use the clearstat,
because otherwise cook's "stat cache" will be incorrect.
.P
This is only an example.
It is better to perform this particular activity using the ``unlink'' flag.
See the [find_command] function, below, for an example.
.H 3 "See Also"
cando, find_command, uptodate
.H 2 "exists-symlink"
This function requires one argument,
being the name of a file to test for existence.
The test will \fInot\fP follow symbolic links,
so it may be used to test for the existence of symbolic links themselves.
The resulting word list is "" (false) if the file does not exist,
and "1" (true) if the file does exist.
.H 3 "See Also"
exists, readlink
