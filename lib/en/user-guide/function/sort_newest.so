.H 2 "sort_newest"
The arguments are sorted by file last-modified time,
youngest to oldest.
File names are resolved first (see the resolve function, below).
Absent files will be sorted to the start of the list.
.H 3 "Example"
This function is often used to "shorten the wait" when building large project,
so that the file you edited most recently is recompiled almost immediately:
.eB
src = [glob *.c];
obj = [sort_newest [fromto %.c %.o [src]]];
.eE
.P
This trick does not always work as expected,
and can take significant time for little result.
.H 3 "See Also"
fromto, glob, sort
