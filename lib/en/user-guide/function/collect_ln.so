.H 2 "collect_lines"
The arguments are interpreted as a command to be passed to the operating system.
The result is one "word" for each
line of the output of the command.
.H 3 "Example"
To read each line of a file into a variable:
.eB
files = [collect_lines cat file];
.eE
Spaces and tabs in the input lines will be preserved
in the "words" of the result.
.H 3 "See Also"
collect, execute, glob, read, read_lines, write
.H 3 Caveat
You will probably get better performance using the
\f[CW]#include-cooked\fP directive, and a recipe to create the included
file.
