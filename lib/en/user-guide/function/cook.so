.H 2 "cook"
This function requires one or more arguments,
filenames to be tested to see if they are up-to-date,
and be brought up-to-date if they are not.
The result are true ("1") if the files are (now) up-to-date,
or false ("") if they could not be built.
.H 3 "Caveat"
This will use as much of the cookbook as has been read in up to the
point where this function is used.  This can mean that crucial recipes
have yet to be parsed and instantiated.
.P
This function works one argument at a time.  This is slower than the
main cookbook, which will pursue all targets simultaneously.
.H 3 "See Also"
