.H 2 "find_command"
This function requires at least one argument,
being the names of commands to search for in $PATH.
The resulting word list contains either "" (false) or a fully qualified
path name for each command given.
.H 3 "Example"
Some systems require
.IR ranlib (1)
to be run on archives,
and some do not.
Here is a simple way to test:
.eB
ranlib = [find_command ranlib];

%.a: [%_obj]
        set unlink
{
        ar qc [target] [%_obj];
        if [ranlib] then
                [ranlib] [target];
}
