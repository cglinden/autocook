.H 2 "matches"
This function requires one or more arguments.
The first argument is a pattern,
the second and later arguments are strings to match against the
pattern.
The resulting wordlist contains "" (false) if did not
match and the 1-based list index (true) if it did.
.P
The returned list index may be used in combination with the [words] function.
.H 3 "Example"
This function may be used to test for
strings which have a particular form:
.eB
if [matches %1C%2 [version]] then
        cc_flags = [cc_flags] -DDEBUG
.eE
If the version contains a Capital-C character, then turn on debugging.
.H 3 "Match Mode"
This function is affected by the selected match mode.
