.H 2 "if"
This function requires one or more arguments,
the arguments before the "then" word are used as a condition.
If the condition is true the words between the "then" word and the
"else" word are the result, otherwise the words after the "else" word
are the value.
The "else" clause is optional.
There is no way to escape the "then" and "else" words.
.H 3 "Example"
Here is an example of the ``if'' function.
Please note that ``if'', ``then'' and ``else'' are reserved words,
so you need to quote them before they will be recognised on
the function context.
.eB
%: %_obj
        set ["if" [defined all_shallow] "then" shallow]
{
        [cc] -o [target] [%_obj];
}
.eE
.H 3 "Caveat"
It is often clearer to use the
.I "if statement"
than this function.
.P
The recipe flags are evaluated at the same time as the recipe targets.
None of the [target], [targets], [need], [younger] variables or pattern
matches (%, %1, \fIetc\fP) are set at this time.
