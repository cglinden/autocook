.H 2 "expr"
This function may be used to calculate simple integer arithmetic expressions.
The numbers and the operators are expected to each be a separate argument.
The result is a string containing the value of the evaluated expression.
.H 3 "Operators"
The following operators are understood.
They have the same precedence as the equivalent C operators.
.TS
center,tab(;);
c c
lf(CW) c.

.TE
Please note that there is no short-circuit evaluation of
the \f(CW?:\fP or \f(CW&&\fP or \f(CW||\fP operators.
.P
You may need to quote some of the operators, to insulate them from their
usual Cook interpretation (colon and equals characters in particular).
.P
Numbers may be given in decimal,
octal (with a \f(CW0\fP prefix), or
hexadecimal (with a \f(CW0x\fP prefix).
The result is always decimal.
