.H 2 "in"
This function requires one or more arguments.
The wordlist returned is a single word: the index of the matching word
(1 based) if the first argument is equal to any of the later ones;
or "" (false) if not.
.P
This function can also be used for equality testing,
just use a single element in the set.
.P
Because it returns the index, the return valus can be used with the
\fI[word]\fP or \fI[words]\fP functions.
.H 3 "Example"
Frequently seen in conditional parts of recipes:
.eB
%: [%_obj]
{
        [cc] -o [target] [%_obj];

                chmod og-rwx [target];
