.H 2 "wildcard"
Each argument is treated as a
.IR sh (1)
file name pattern,
and expanded accordingly.
The resulting list of filenames is sorted lexicographically.
.P
You may need to quote the pattern,
to protect square brackets from the meaning cook attaches to them.
.P
.B Note:
The character sequence \f(CW/*\fP is a comment introducer,
and is a frequent source of problems when combined with the
.I wildcard
function.
Remember to quote
.I wildcard
arguments which need this character sequence.
.H 3 "Example"
To find the sources in the current directory:
.eB
src = [wildcard *.c];
obj = [patsubst %.c %.o [src]];
.eE
.H 3 "See Also"
filter, filter_out, patsubst
.H 3 "Also Known As"
