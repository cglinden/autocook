.H 2 "uptodate"
This function may be used to determine if files are up-to-date.
It returns a word list containing the names of the up-to-date files,
or empty if none of them are up-to-date.
They are \fInot\fP brought up to date if they are not already.
This function requires one or more arguments.
.H 3 "Caveat"
This will use as much of the cookbook as has been read in up to the
point where this function is used.  This can mean that crucial recipes
have yet to be parsed and instanciated.
.H 3 "See Also"
cando, cook
