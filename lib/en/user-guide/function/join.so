.H 2 "join"
The
.I join
function is used to join two sets of strings together,
element by element.
The argument list must contain an even number of arguments,
with the first half joined pair-wise with the last half.
There is no marker of any kind between the lists,
so the user needs to ensure they are both the same length.
