.H 2 "not"
This function requires zero or more arguments,
the value to be logically negated.
It returns "1" (true) if all of the arguments are "" (false),
or there are no arguments;
and returns "" (false) otherwise.
This is symmetric with the definition of true and false for
.BR if .
.H 3 "Example"
This is often seen in recipes:
.eB
%1/%0%2.o: %1/%0%2.c
        single-thread %2.o
{
        if [not [exists [dirname [target]]]] then
                mkdir -p [dirname [target]]
                        set clearstat;
        [cc] [cc_flags] -I%1 %1/%0%2.c;
        mv %2.o [target];
}
.eE
Note that "\f(CW%0\fP" matches zero or more whole filename portions,
including the trailing slash.
See the chapter on pattern matching for more information.
.P
This is an example only.
The ``mkdir'' recipe flag creates the directory more efficiently.
