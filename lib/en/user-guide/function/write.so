.H 2 "write"
This function requires one or more arguments.
The first argument is the name of the file to write,
the second an later arguments are lines to be written to the file.
(This is specifically a text file.)
The result is an empty word list.
.P
This function is very useful in writing command line file for Windows-NT,
due to its absurdly short command line interface.
