.H 2 "basename"
The
.I basename
treats each argument as filenames,
and extracts all but the suffix of each filename.
If the filename contains a period,
the basename is everything up to (but not including) the period.
Otherwise,
the basename is the entire filename.
.P
Please note: this is not the same behavior as the Unix
\fIbasename\fP(1) utility.  For this, \f(CW[basename
[notdir\fP \fIargs\fP\f(CW]]\fP or
\f(CW[fromto %0%.c %0% \fP\fIargs\fP\f(CW]\fP
may be more appropriate.

.H 3 "Caveat"
This function is almost nothing like the Unix command of the same name.
It operates in this manner for compatibility with other packages.
