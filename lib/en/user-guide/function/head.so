.H 2 "head"
This function requires zero or more arguments.
The wordlist returned is empty if there were no arguments,
or the first argument if there were arguments.
.H 3 "Example"
You can iterate along a list using the
.I loop
statement combined with the
.I head
and
.I tail
functions:
.eB
dirs = a b c d;
src = ;

tmp = [dirs];
loop
{
        tmp_dir = [head [tmp]];
        if [not [tmp_dir]] then
                loopstop;
        tmp = [tail [tmp]];
        src = [src] [glob [tmp_dir]"/*.c"];
}
.eE
More efficient ways exist to do this,
this an example only.
