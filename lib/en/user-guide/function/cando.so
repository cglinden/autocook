.H 2 "cando"
This function is used to test whether Cook knows how to cook the given
targets.  It returns all of the arguments for which derivations can be
found, or nothing if none can.
.H 3 "Caveat"
This will use as much of the cookbook as has been read in up to the
point where this function is used.  This can mean that crucial recipes
have yet to be parsed and instantiated.
.H 3 "See Also"
