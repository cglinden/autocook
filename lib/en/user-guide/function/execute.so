.H 2 "execute"
This function requires at least one argument, and
executes the command given by the arguments.
If the executed command returns non-zero exit status
the resulting value is "" (false),
otherwise it is "1" (true).
.P
The command will not be echoed unless the -No_Silent option
is specified on the command line.
.H 3 "Caveat"
This function is not often required as its
functionality is available in a more useful form as recipe bodies.

To get access to a wide range of Unix command, such as \fItest\fP(1),
you can use this function in conditionals
