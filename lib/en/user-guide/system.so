.H 1 "Supplied Cookbooks"
A number of cookbooks are supplied with
.BR cook .
To make use of one, a preprocessor directive of the form
.eB
#include "\f(CIwhichone\fP"
.eE
must appear at the start of your cookbook.
.P
.B Cook
does not have any "built-in" recipes.
All recipes are stored in text files,
so they are more easily read, understood, copied, hacked or corrected.
The supplied cookbooks live in the
.I \*[datadir]
directory.
.P
You may supply your own "system" recipes,
by placing cookbooks into a directory called
.IR $HOME/.cook
or using the
.B -Include
command line option,
possibly in your
.I $COOK
environment variable.
.so system.list.so
