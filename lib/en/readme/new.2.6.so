.\"
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fIcook_bom\fP(1) command (Bill Of Materials).
This may be used to efficiently scan a directory tree for files,
so that ingredients lists may be produced automatically.
See \fIcook_bom\fP(1) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new assign-append statement, so you can now use \f[CW]+=\fP
to append to the value of a variable.  See the User Guide for more
information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fIgate-first\fP recipe flag, which causes the recipe gate
to be evaluated before the ingredients are derived, rather than after.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIc_incl\fP(1) command has a new --interior-files option, so you can
tell it about include files that don't exist yet.  This is helpful when
they are generated, \fIi.e.\fP they are interior files of the dependency
graph, hence the option name.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new [interior-files] function, which returns the files interior
to the dependency graph (constructed by a recipe), and a complementatry
[leaf-files] function, which returns the leaf files of the dependency
graph (not constructed by any recipe).
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new ``no-include-cooked-warning'' flag, if you want to suppress
the warnings about derived file dependencies in include-cooked files.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fIrelative_dirname\fP built-in function, similar to the
existing \fIdirname\fP function, but it returns ``.'' for files with no
directory part, rather than the absolute path of the current directory.
