.\" MANIFEST: document describing new 2.8 features
.\"
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new ``for each'' style looping construct.
See the User Guide for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
It is now possible to use regular expression patterns, instead of Cook's
native patterns.  You can set this for a whole cookbook or individual
recipes.  The default is to use Cook's native patterns.  See the \fIFile
Name Patterns\fP chapter of the User Guide for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
A bug which caused \fIhost-binding\fP and \fIsingle-thread\fP to core
dump has been fixed.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
All text file input now copes with CRLF sequences, so mixing NT and Unix
builds on the one file server no longer creates problems.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
Fingerprints are now cached per-directory, rather than one huge file for
an entire directory tree.  This is more useful in recursive build and
[search_list] situations.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The [cando], [cook] and [uptodate] functions now return lists of
successful files, rather than a simple true/false result.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The [in] and [matches] functions now return the list index (1 based)
of the matching word.
See the User Guide for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fIcook -web\fP option, to print a HTML web page on the
standard output, representing the dependency graph.  This is useful in
documenting the build process, or debugging cookbooks.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fIcook --fingerprint-update\fP option which scans
the directory tree below the current directory and updates the file
fingerprints.  This helps when you use another tool (such as RCS or
ClearCase) which alters the file but preserves the file's modification
time.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new [write] function for writing text files.
This is useful for coping with Windows-NT's absurdly short command lines.
