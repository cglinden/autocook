.SH NAME
cook \- a file construction tool
.XX "" "The README File"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I cook
program is a tool for constructing files,
and maintaining referential integrity between files.
It is given a set of files to create,
and recipes of how to create and maintain them.
In any non-trivial program there will be
prerequisites to performing the actions necessary to
creating any file,
such as include files.
The
.I cook
program provides a mechanism to define these.
.PP
When a program is being developed or maintained,
the programmer will typically change one file of several which
comprise the program.
The
.I cook
program examines the last-modified times of the files
to see when the prerequisites of a file have changed,
implying that the file needs to be recreated as it is logically out of date.
.PP
The
.I cook
program also provides a facility for implicit recipes,
allowing users to specify how to form a file with a
given suffix from a file with a different suffix.
For example,
to create
.IR filename .o
from
.IR filename .c

Cook has a simple but powerful string-based description language with

performance.

.if t \(bu
Cook is able to build your project with multiple parallel threads, with
support for rules which must be single threaded.  It is possible to
distribute parallel builds over your LAN, allowing you to turn your
network into a virtual parallel build engine.

Cook is able to use fingerprints to supplement file modification
times.  This allows build optimization without contorted rules.
T};T{

.if n *
.if t \(bu
Cook can be configured with an explicit list of primary source files.
This allow the dependency graph to be constructed faster by not going
down dead ends, and also allows better error messages when the graph
can't be constructed.  This requires an accurate source file manifest.
T}

In addition to walking the dependency graph,
Cook can turn the input rules into a shell script, or a web page.

.if n *
.if t \(bu
Cook runs on almost any flavor of UNIX.  The source distribution is self
configuring using a GNU Autoconf generated configure script.
T};T{
.sp 0.5
.if n *
.if t \(bu
Cook has special \fIcascade\fP dependencies, allowing powerful include
dependency specification, amongst other things.

.PP
If you are putting together a source-code distribution and planning to
write a makefile, consider writing a cookbook instead.  Although
Cook takes a day or two to learn, it is much more powerful and a bit
more intuitave than the traditional \fImake\fP(1) tool.
And Cook doesn't interpret tab differently to 8 space characters!
