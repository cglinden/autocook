.\" MANIFEST: document describing new 2.9 features
.\"
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 31
The \fI[print]\fP and \fI[write]\fP functions now work more sensably
with the \fB\-SCript\fP option.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 30
The fingerprint code has been improved.
It now does considerably fewer redundant fingeprint calculations,
resulting is some very welcome speed improvements.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 29
The behaviour of the remote shell invocation to cope with rshd at the
remote end failing to spawn a shell, and it copes with the default shell
at the remote end not being the Bourne shell.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 25
The \fB\-PARallel\fP behaviour has been improved, so that it now looks
for child process who have finished \fImore than\fP it looks for recipes
to run.  This doesn't change the semantics any, but it matches user
expectations far better (and results in shorter-lived zombie processes).
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 25
The \fIset meter\fP recipe flag works once more.  (It stopped working
when the parallel modifications were made, and mysteriously forgotten
until now.)
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 22
There are some changes made to the fingerprinting code to detect when
files under ClearCase move backwards in time (because the underlying
file version is ``uncovered'') meaning that the derived (object) files
need to be rebuilt.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 21
There is a new [mtime-seconds] function, similar to the [mtime] function,
except that it returns seconds since the epoch, rather than a human
readable date.  More useful to handing to [expr].
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 20
A bug has been fixed on SGI IRIX which failed to cope with not being
able to create directories because they already exist.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 17
Ingredient recipes (ones with no body) may now have a double colon rather
than a single colon, even when there is more than on target specified.
Some users may find this a more natural syntax for ingredients recipes.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 15
The [expr] function now reports an error when given a number too big to
represent, rather than quietly returning wrong answers.  The range of
representable values depends on your system.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 11
Cook now works with GNU Regex correctly on Windows-NT.
