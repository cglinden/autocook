.\" MANIFEST: document describing new 2.2 features

.PP

There are 6 new special variables:
graph_leaf_file,
graph_leaf_pattern,
graph_interior_file,
graph_interior_pattern,
graph_exterior_file and
graph_exterior_pattern.
These variables may be used
to define the leaves of the derivation graph (the \fIaccept\fP forms),
and non-leave of the graph (the \fIreject\fP forms).  This can make
the graph derivation faster, and greatly improves some error messages.
This functionality is of most use when you have an exact source file
manifest, \fIe.g.\fP from a software configuration management system.
See the User Guide for more information.

There is a new statement type, allowing functions to be invoked as
subroutines in any place where a command may be invoked.  See the User
Guide for more information.

A number of problems with installing Cook have been fixed.
This includes changing -mgm to -mm for the documnetation formatting,
and missing include dependencies and missing rules for installing the man pages.

.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new ``print'' builtin function.
When combined with the new function call statement,
this provides a way of printing information without invoking ``echo''.
See the User Guide for more information.

.if t \(bu
Cook now defaults the language to ``en'' internally if neoither the
LANG nor LANGUAGE environment variable was set.  This gives better
error messages.

A bug was fixed where a recipe would fail to trigger if some, but not
all, of its targets were not present, but the existing targets were
up-to-date.  This bug was introduced in the inference engine re-write.
