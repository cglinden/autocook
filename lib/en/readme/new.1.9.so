to allow Fortran sources, in addition to C sources.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new [options] function,
which expands to the current settings of the command line options.
This is useful for recursive cook directory structures.
See the Reference Manual for more information.

.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new ``recursive'' cookbook,
to assist in constructing recursive cook structures.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The
.I find_libs
program now understands about shared libraries.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
A bug which made the builtin [glob] function
far to generous has been corrected.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
A bug which caused some expression evaluation errors to be ignored
has been corrected.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The ``set update'' flag has been re-named the ``set time-adjust'' flag,
to more closely describe what it does.
The old name will continue to work indefinitely.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new ``set time-adjust-back'' flag, which sets recipe target times
to be exactly one (1) second younger than the youngest ingredient.
This is usually an adjustment into the recent past.
