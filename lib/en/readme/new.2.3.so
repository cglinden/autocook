There is a new form of dependencies.  Known as cascaded dependencies, they
allow the user to associate additional dependencies with an ingredient.
For example, a C source file can be associated with cascaded include
dependencies.  This means that all files which depend on the C source
file, also depend on the included files.
The Cook Reference Manual has been updated to include this new functionality.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new section of the Cook Reference Manual giving suggestions
and a template for building large projects.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \f(CW[expr]\fP function, to calculate simple arithmetic
expressions.  See the User Guide for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new c_incl -no-recursion option, to prevent scanning nested
includes.
This is of most use when combined with the new cascade dependencies.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \f(CW[exists-symlink]\fP function, which may be used to
test for the existence of symlinks.  The \f(CW[exists]\fP function follows
symbolic links, and is not useful when manipulating the links themselves.
