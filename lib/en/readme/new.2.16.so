When using file fingerprints, the way the \fI\&.cook.fp\fP file is
written has been changed, so that the timestamp of the containing
directory is modified much less often.  This is useul in combination
with the \fIcook_bom\fP(1) utility.

fingerprinted correctly.

A bug has been fixed in the \f[CW][uptodate]\fP function.
It now works as advertised.

.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 16
There is a new \fIingredients-fingerprint\fP recipe flag.  This means
that you can now cause a recipe to re-trigger when the ingredients list
changes.  This is especially useful when a library has a file removed.

.if t \(bu
.\" change 15
The dependency graph can now have the edge types specified.  The ``weak''
edge type if useful for managing links, and the ``exists'' edge type
is useful for managing version stamps.  See the User Guide for more
information.
