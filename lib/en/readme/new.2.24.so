The \fI./configure\fP script now understands the \fI--with-nlsdir\fP
option, used to specify the install location of the \f[CW].mo\fP
files.
.PP

.if t \(bu
.\" change 21
A bug has been fixed on Linux (and it only ever ocurred on
Linux) where cook would suddenly stop for no reason with
exit status 1.  Turns out that sometimes fflush(stderr)
returns an EAGAIN error.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 19
A bug has been fixed which caused the \fIcook \-script\fP option
to produce invalid shell scripts when a recipe body
contained no statements.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 15
A bug has been fixed in the graph file pair generation,
used to generate warnings about dangerous #include-cooked
contents.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 18
The metering output now includes elapsed times and percentages.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 17
There is a new \f[I]tell-position\fP setting, so that when Cook prints a
command it is about to run, it includes the file name and line nunmber
of the command.  This can be useful when debugging cookbooks.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 12
A bug has been fixed in the output line wrapping.
Once again it adapts to the window width.
