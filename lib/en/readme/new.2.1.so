The \fIc_incl\fP utility has had two new languages added.
It now understands M4, and also has an ``optimistic'' language
which can scan many assemblers and even some high-level languages.
See \fIc_incl\fP(1) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIc_incl\fP utility also has a new \f[CW]--no-absolute-path\fP
option, to supress scanning and reporting of such files.
See \fIc_incl\fP(1) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new warning added for dependencies on derived ingredients
when this information resides solely in derived cookbooks included using
the \f[CW]#include-cooked\fP facility.  This assists in detecting
problems which may preclude a successful ``clean'' build.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
This release adds a number of cookbook functions to the distrubuted
cookbooks.  These may be used by adding a
.nf
.in +4m
#include "functions"
.in -4m
.fi
line to your cookbook.  See the Cook User Guide for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
This release fixes a bug where the graph walking phase ignored
interrupts until something went wrong.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
This release fixes a bug where \fImake2cook\fP did not correctly
translate ``%'' into sematicly equivalent Cook constructs.
