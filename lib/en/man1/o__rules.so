.\" MANIFEST: description of option up/down case convention
.\"
.PP
All options may be abbreviated;
the abbreviation is documented as the upper case letters,
all lower case letters and underscores (_) are optional.
You must use consecutive sequences of optional letters.
.PP
All options are case insensitive,
you may type them in upper case or lower case or a combination of both,
case is not important.
.PP
For example:
the arguments "-help", "-HEL" and "-h" are
all interpreted to mean the \fB-Help\fP option.
The argument "-hlp" will not be understood,
because consecutive optional characters were not supplied.
.PP
Options and other command line arguments may be
mixed arbitrarily on the command line.
.br
.ne 4
.PP
The GNU long option names are understood.
Since all option names for
.I \*(n)
are long,
this means ignoring the extra leading '-'.
The "\fB--\fIoption\fB=\fIvalue\fR" convention is also understood.
