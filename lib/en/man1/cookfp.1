.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*(n)
program is used to
calculate the fingerprints of files.
A fingerprint is a hash of the contents of a file.
The default fingerprint is cryptographically strong,
so the probability of two different files having the
same fingerprint is less than 1 in 2**200.
.PP
The fingerprint is based on Dan Berstien <djb@silverton.berkeley.edu>
public domain fingerprint 0.50 beta package 930809,
posted to the alt.sources newsgroup.
This program produces identical results;
the expected test results were generated using Dan's package.
.PP
The
fingerprint is a base-64-sanely-encoded fingerprint of the input.
Imagine this fingerprint as something universal and permanent.
A fingerprint is 76 characters long, containing the following:
.TP 4n
1.
A Snefru-8 (version 2.5, 8 passes, 512->256) hash.
(Derived from the Xerox Secure Hash Function.)
.TP 4n
2.
An MD5 hash, as per RFC 1321.
(Derived from the RSADSI MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm.)
.TP 4n
3.
A CRC checksum, as in the new cksum utility.
.TP 4n
4.
Length modulo 2^40.
.PP
The output format is not expected to be compatible with anything.
However,
options are available to produce
the purported output of Merkle's snefru program,
the purported output of RSADSI's mddriver -x,
or the purported output of the POSIX cksum program.
.PP
If no files are named as input,
the standard input will be used.
The special file name ``-'' is understood to mean the standard input.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options are understood:
.TP 8n
.B -Checksum
Print the CRC32 checksum and length of the named file(s).
.TP 8n
.B -Identifier
Print a condensed form of the fingerprint (obtained by performing a
CRC32 checksum on the full fingerprint described above - a definite
overkill).
This is an 8-digit hexadecimal number,
useful for generating unique short identifiers out of long names.
The first character is forced to be a letter (g-p),
so there is no problem in using the output as a variable name.
.TP 8n
.B -Help
.br
Provide some help with using the
.I \*(n)
program.
.TP 8n
.B -Message_Digest
Print the
RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm
hash of the named file(s).
.TP 8n
.B -Snefru
Print the Snefru hash of the named file(s),
derived from the Xerox Secure Hash Function.
.TP 8n
.B -VERSion
.br
Print the version of the
.I \*(n)
program being executed.
.PP
All other options will produce a diagnostic error.
