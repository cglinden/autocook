I am pleased to announce that \*(N) \*(v) is now available.
.sp
The cook program is a tool for constructing files,
and maintaining referential integrity between files.
.sp
Cook is a replacement for the traditional \fImake\fP(1) tool.
However, it is necessary to convert makefiles into cookbooks using
the \fImake2cook\fP utility included in the distribution.
.sp
You are invited to visit
.ce 1
http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~millerp/\*(n)/
for a more complete description of what \*(N) is, and access to the
download files.
New features and bug fixes are described in the \*(n)-\*(v).README file.
.sp
If you are putting together a source-code distribution and planning to
write a makefile, consider writing a cookbook instead.  Although
Cook takes a day or two to learn, it is much more powerful and a bit
more intuitive than the traditional \fImake\fP(1) tool.
And Cook doesn't interpret tab differently to 8 space characters!
