/*
 * NAME
 *      as - assembler cookbook
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      This cookbook defines how to use the assembler
 *
 * RECIPES
 *      %.o: %.s        construct object friles from assembler source files
 *
 * VARIABLES
 *      as              The assembler command.
 *                      Not altered if already defined.
 *      as_flags        Options to pass the assembler command.
 *                      Not altered if already defined.
 *                      The default is empty.
 *      as_src          Assembler source files in the current directory.
 *      dot_src         Source files constructable in the current directory
 *                      (unioned with existing setting, if necessary).
 *      dot_obj         Object files constructable in the current directory
 *                      (unioned with existing setting, if necessary).
 *      dot_clean       Files which may be removed from the current directory
 *                      in a clean target.
