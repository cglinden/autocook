This is a little sample source tree demonstrating some of the capabilities
of the autobuild extension to cook.

The structure here represents the recommended top level layout for a large
project. The Howto.cook file here is a real one. All "b" does is cd into
this directory, then run cook with an argument specifying where in the
source tree "b" was invoked. 

There are four sample "hello world" variants, each demonstrating commonly
used patterns. There are many more, and some of them will be added in
future versions.

src/hello_world_1    A simple executable;
src/hello_world_2    A complex executable compiled from two source files
src/hello_world_3    A simple executable and a library;
src/hello_world_4    A simple executable with a library and a third party
                     dependency.

pkg/hello_world      An rpm packing up all of the four executables above.

3party/noarch/       Sample third party package used by hello_world_4.
